# To-Do Web App

A clean and interactive **To-Do Web Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to add daily tasks, mark them as completed, and see them automatically move into a separate "Completed Tasks" list — helping users manage and track their progress efficiently.

---

## Objective

To build a simple task management web app where users can:

- Add new tasks
- View pending tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- View completed tasks separately

This app helps improve productivity by visually distinguishing between tasks yet to be done and those already completed.
